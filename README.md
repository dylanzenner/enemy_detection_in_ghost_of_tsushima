# Enemy Detection in Ghost of Tsushima

A cascade classifier built using OpenCV for detecting enemy NPCs in the 2020 action-adventure game *Ghost of Tsushima* by Sucker Punch Productions.


# Steps for replication

### Step 1 Environment Setup:

You will need the following before starting this project:
-   A PlayStation 5 (or any console with *Ghost of Tsushima* in stalled)
-   PS Remote Play installed on the machine you will be creating the project on


### Step 2 Data Collection:
Before we start the data collection we will need to set up our development environment. I am using Pycharm but you can use whatever you are comfortable with
-   The first thing we need to do is create a function which will allow us to take screen shots of the game while we are playing it. The images captured will be used to train the cascade classifier
